1.Write a blog on the difference between Document and window objects.

Document object:

It represents any HTML document that is loaded in the browser.
It is loaded inside the window.
It is the object of window property.
All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.
We can access the document from a window using the window. document
Syntax:
document.property_name; 
Example:  document.title; :  will return the title of the document

Window Object:

It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.   
It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.
It is the object of the browser.
Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.
We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window
Syntax:
window.property_name;
Example: window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser
